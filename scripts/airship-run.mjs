/**
 * Runs the workspace's own build of the CLI, rebuilding it first if it is stale.
 *
 * This is what `./airship` and `airship.cmd` call. It is a PASSTHROUGH: every
 * argument goes to the CLI untouched, so `./airship <anything>` behaves exactly
 * like the published `airship` binary. `make run` and friends are presets on
 * top of it, not a different path.
 *
 *   ./airship --target 3000 --cwd ../my-app
 *   ./airship doctor
 *   ./airship                       # the real wizard, same as a user gets
 *
 * Why it exists at all: apps/cli/tsup.config.ts sets `noExternal: [/^@airship\//]`,
 * so every workspace package is INLINED into apps/cli/dist/index.js — that is why
 * they are all devDependencies, and why the published tarball declares no
 * @airship/* dependency. The consequence is easy to miss: a change anywhere in
 * packages/* does nothing until the CLI is rebuilt. The Makefile could not catch
 * that (`$(CLI):` was a file rule with no source prerequisites, so it only fired
 * when dist was missing), which meant editing the overlay and running `make run`
 * silently ran the old bundle.
 *
 * So: mtime-scan the sources, and shell out to turbo only when something moved.
 * The scan is NOT a reimplementation of turbo's cache — turbo remains the source
 * of truth for what actually needs rebuilding. The scan is a ~8ms doorman in
 * front of a ~150ms turbo run, which is worth having on a command you type all
 * day. It is deliberately coarse: a false positive costs one cached turbo run,
 * a false negative runs stale code.
 *
 * Wrapper-owned flags, consumed here and never forwarded:
 *
 *   --skip-build    skip the scan and the build       (AIRSHIP_SKIP_BUILD=1)
 *   --force-build   build regardless of the scan      (AIRSHIP_FORCE_BUILD=1)
 *
 * They are NOT airship flags and will not appear in `airship --help`.
 *
 * They are deliberately not called `--no-build`, which is the obvious name and
 * the wrong one: apps/cli/src/lib/args.ts generates `--no-<name>` for every
 * boolean flag, and the README documents that as user-facing syntax. `--no-build`
 * therefore reads as CLI syntax, and would become argv this script silently ate
 * the day anyone adds a boolean `build` flag. Anything before a `--` is fair game
 * for us; anything after it is the CLI's, matching `assertKnownFlags`.
