# Asserts the version just published actually has a README on npmjs.com.
#
# Why this exists: npmjs.com does not read the README out of the tarball. It
# renders the `readme` field of the version manifest, which the CLIENT attaches
# at publish time — and `pnpm publish` does not attach it. v0.2.2 shipped a
# tarball with a perfectly good README.md inside and a package page that still
# read "This package does not have a README". verify-tarball.sh could not catch
# it: the tarball was correct. Only the registry can tell you.
#
#   bash scripts/verify-published-readme.sh [version]
#
# Version defaults to whatever apps/cli/package.json holds. Runs after publish,
# so it cannot prevent a bad release — it makes one loud instead of silent, and
# the fix is always the next patch (npm never lets you republish a version).
