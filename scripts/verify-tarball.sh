# Asserts the @provider-web-artisans/cli tarball is actually shippable before it goes out.
#
# Why this exists: `files: ["dist"]` silently matches nothing when dist/ has not
# been built, so `pnpm publish` succeeds and ships a package.json and a LICENSE.
# npm reports that as a clean publish, the version number is burned forever, and
# the breakage only surfaces when a user runs `npx airship`. A --dry-run does not
# catch it — it packs the same empty tarball and exits 0.
#
# So: pack for real, look inside, and fail loudly on anything missing.
#
#   bash scripts/verify-tarball.sh            # pack one, then inspect it
#   bash scripts/verify-tarball.sh path.tgz   # inspect a tarball already packed
#
# CI passes the tarball it is about to publish, so the bytes asserted here are
# the bytes that ship. Packing a second one just for the check would leave a
# gap for exactly the kind of difference this script exists to catch.
#
# Packing uses `pnpm pack`, not `npm pack`: only pnpm rewrites the `workspace:*`
# devDependencies into real versions, and npm would ship the literal protocol.
#
# Assumes the CLI is already built (`pnpm turbo run build --filter=@provider-web-artisans/cli`).

# README.md is generated from the root one by scripts/sync-readme.mjs and is the
# only thing npmjs.com has to show for the package. Without it the page reads
# "This package does not have a README" — which is how 0.2.1 shipped — and the
# version number is spent, because npm never lets you republish one.
