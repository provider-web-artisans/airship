# Publishes a packed tarball to npm with provenance, retrying the Sigstore flake.
#
# Why this exists: `--provenance` makes npm POST a signed provenance bundle to
# Sigstore's Rekor transparency log before the package goes out. When that POST
# hangs, npm's own HTTP layer retries the IDENTICAL payload and Rekor answers
#
#   npm error code TLOG_CREATE_ENTRY_ERROR
#   npm error error creating tlog entry - (409) an equivalent entry already
#   exists in the transparency log
#
# — a duplicate rejection, not a real failure. That is how v0.2.4 died: git got
# the release commit and the tag, npm never got the package, and the run turned
# red 42 seconds into a publish that had nothing wrong with it.
#
# Retrying HERE works where npm's internal retry cannot. npm's retry replays the
# same bytes and the same signature, so Rekor keeps seeing a duplicate; a fresh
# `npm publish` process mints a new ephemeral signing key, which produces a
# different log entry that Rekor accepts.
#

# Only transient codes are retried — an expired token fails on the first attempt
# rather than burning a minute proving it three times.
#
# Env knobs:
#   ATTEMPTS=n   how many publishes to try (default 3)
#   DELAY=n      seconds before the second attempt, doubled for the third
#                (default 15) — set to 0 to exercise the retry paths in a test
