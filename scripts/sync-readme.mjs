// Generates apps/cli/README.md from the root README.md.
//
// Why this exists: npm renders a package's README from the PACKAGE directory,
// and apps/cli has never had one — so @provider-web-artisans/cli's npm page reads "This
// package does not have a README" while a 400-line one sits at the repo root.
// pnpm copies the root LICENSE into a workspace package that lacks one; it does
// not do the same for README, and `files: ["dist"]` does not reach up either.
//
// Copying it verbatim is not enough. npm resolves relative links against
// `repository.directory` (apps/cli), where media/cover.png does not exist — so
// every screenshot would 404 on npmjs.com. This rewrites them to absolute
// GitHub URLs: raw.githubusercontent for images (the blob view serves HTML, not
// an image) and blob for everything else. In-page anchors are left alone; npm's
// renderer generates the same heading slugs.

// The generated file is committed, like apps/web/src/routeTree.gen.ts, and
// checks.yml runs --check on every PR. Root README.md is the only copy anyone
// edits.
