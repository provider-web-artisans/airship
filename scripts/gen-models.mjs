// Generates packages/protocol/src/models.ts — the seed model catalogue — from
// the models.dev registry.
//
// Why a seed exists at all: of the five harnesses, three can enumerate their own
// models. Claude answers `query.supportedModels()`, OpenCode answers
// `client.config.providers()` and pi answers `pi --list-models`, all live and
// scoped to what the user actually has. **Codex can enumerate nothing** — no CLI
// subcommand, no app-server RPC, no config file to read. Without this its list
// would be a constant somebody has to remember to edit on every OpenAI release,
// and the failure mode of forgetting is silent: the picker just stops offering
// the model you wanted.
//
// pi and dsh are the other case: models.dev does not describe them, so there is
// nothing to derive and their rows are carried verbatim from the `hand` block in
// the curation file. dsh could enumerate, but only by opening an ACP session —
// which persists a session on disk — so its list is hand-maintained too.
//
// The seed also does two smaller jobs. It is what the menu paints *before* the
// live probe returns, so opening the picker is never a wait; and it is what the
// menu falls back to when a probe fails or there is no network.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/gen-models.mjs           # fetch and write
//   node scripts/gen-models.mjs --check   # verify without writing
//
// `--check` exists for local use — `make preflight` deliberately does NOT run
// it. Every other generated file in this repo derives from something committed
// beside it, so a drift gate can only fire when a human changed the input. This
// one derives from a remote file that changes whenever a vendor ships a model,
// so gating on it would make the gate go red on PRs that touched nothing and
// require network to pass. `reference/NEXT-STEPS.md` §7 describes what that
// costs: "the gate will fail on every single PR forever."
//
// Refresh is therefore a deliberate act — `make models:refresh` — reviewed as a
// diff, the way a lockfile bump is.
