# Controls

Every keyboard shortcut and pointer gesture in the Airship editor.

Press `?` in the editor for the same list with whatever is live right now
highlighted, or `⌘K` to search the commands and run one.

A shortcut never fires while you are typing, with one exception: a field's
own `⌘↵`. On Safari the browser keeps `⌘+` and `⌘-` for its own zoom, so
the editor also answers to a plain `+` and `-`.
