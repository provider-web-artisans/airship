/**
 * Which surface a given HTML request should be served as.
 *
 * The canvas replaces the app at the top level, so under it a plain navigation
 * gets the shell and the app itself is only ever reached through a frame. Four
 * cases, and the order matters:
 *
 * 1. An explicit `?__airship=` wins — it is how the shell addresses its frames,
 *    and how either surface can be forced for one request without disturbing
 *    the sticky preference.
 * 2. `Sec-Fetch-Dest: iframe` means the app is being loaded *into* a frame.
 *    Checking this, and not only the query param, is what keeps client-side
 *    routing inside a frame working: an in-frame navigation to `/settings`
 *    drops the param, and without this the frame would be served a nested
 *    shell — a canvas inside a canvas.
 *
 *    Only under the canvas, though. Inline has no shell driving frames, so an
 *    iframe in that document is the app's own — a video embed, a payment form —
 *    and installing a frame agent in it would be injecting into a third party
 *    for no purpose.
 *
 *    And only for *our own* frames. A frame the canvas creates is same-origin
 *    by construction, so its requests carry `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`. A
 *    frame some other document owns — a harness that shows the editor in a
 *    sidebar tab, an IDE panel — reports `same-site`, `cross-site` or `none`,
 *    and to that document the editor is the whole page: it is a navigation as
 *    far as the surface choice goes, and it takes the sticky preference or the
 *    launch default like one. Without this, the editor could only ever be
 *    reached in such a host by an explicit `?__airship=`, and the first in-app
 *    link or surface switch — which drop the param — would replace it with a
 *    bare frame answering to no shell. A missing `Sec-Fetch-Site` counts as
 *    same-origin, which is the older behaviour exactly.
 * 3. A document navigation gets the sticky surface if one is set, else the
 *    launch default. A missing `Sec-Fetch-Dest` counts: the header is
 *    near-universal in browsers, and a client old enough to omit it is one
 *    typing a URL in, which is a navigation.
 *
 *    The cookie is read *here* and nowhere else on purpose. It is a preference
 *    about top-level navigation only; consulted any earlier it could hijack a
 *    frame or an HTML partial, neither of which the user is choosing a surface
 *    for.
 * 4. Everything else passes through untouched. An app fetching an HTML partial
 *    reports `Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty`, and its own data loading is none of our
 *    business — handing it a canvas shell would corrupt the response.
