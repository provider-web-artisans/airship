/*
 * The model precedence chain, which is the whole of the model workstream's
 * server half.
 *
 * Three inputs can name a model — the turn, the per-backend default the CLI
 * resolved from `--claude-model` and friends, and the cross-harness `--model` —
 * and the order they win in is the only thing that decides what a turn runs on.
 * None of it was covered: `serve.test.ts` pins the CLI's half of the same chain
 * (how the flags collapse into `models`), and this pins what the daemon then
 * does with it.
 *
 * The per-backend map is what makes a mid-session harness switch safe. A single
 * shared default would follow the picker and hand Codex an id only Claude
 * answers to, which is the bug the map exists to prevent — the last case here.
