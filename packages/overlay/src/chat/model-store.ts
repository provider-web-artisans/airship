/**
 * The picker's choice, remembered between sessions.
 *
 * Its own module rather than a pair of methods on `AirshipApp` — which is what
 * the dock's widths and layout are — for one reason: this is the only stored
 * state in the overlay that is written *eagerly*. The canvas's viewport and
 * frame layouts save through a callback that tests simply never trigger, so
 * they have never needed `localStorage` to exist. This saves on every pick, so
 * it does, and a module is something a test can drive without standing up the
 * whole app.
 *
 * Reading is deliberately forgiving. The value is a convenience, and anything
 * unparseable, half-written or left over from an older shape has to degrade to
 * "nothing stored" rather than take the editor down on boot.
