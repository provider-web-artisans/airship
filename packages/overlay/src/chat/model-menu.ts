/**
 * "Which backend, on which model?", as menu content.
 *
 * The header used to ask only the first half, because the second was settled at
 * launch by `--model` and could not be changed without restarting the daemon.
 * Splitting them into two controls was the obvious shape and the wrong one: a
 * model id only means anything against a backend — `claude-opus-5` is not a
 * thing Codex can run — so two independent pickers would spend most of their
 * time in states that cannot be sent.
 *
 * So it stays one menu, and the grouping carries the pairing: one collapsible
 * group per harness, and choosing any row inside it chooses both. This is the
 * same construction `canvas/device-menu.ts` uses for the device presets, for
 * the same reason — a flat column of every model across three backends is a
 * scroll, and four lines you open one of is a menu.
