/**
 * Every command the editor answers to, declared once.
 *
 * Chords used to be string literals at the `keys.bind` call site, and the only
 * thing that knew a command existed was the line that bound it. That made three
 * things impossible and one thing silently wrong:
 *
 * - **Nothing could enumerate the bindings**, so there was no shortcuts panel
 *   and no command palette, and twenty-seven of the thirty-three shortcuts were
 *   undiscoverable unless you already knew them.
 * - **Nothing could document them.** The only shortcut reference in the repo
 *   was a hand-written six-row table in `README.md`, and its copy in
 *   `apps/cli/README.md` had already drifted two rows out of date.
 * - **A tooltip found its chord by matching its own text against a binding's
 *   `label`.** Reword the tooltip and the chip silently disappears; name two
 *   commands "Delete" and one of them shadows the other's chip. Both happened.
 *   `tooltip.copy.test.ts` existed to freeze thirteen spellings by hand, and it
 *   was missing four of them.
 * - **Five menu rows spelled their own chords** — `"⌘+"` where the binding was
 *   `mod+=`, Mac glyphs rendered on Windows, and a `⌘Z` on a row wired to the
 *   server-side revert, a feature `app.ts` warns must never be reached by ⌘Z.
 *
 * So the declaration lives here and the implementation stays where it belongs.
 * A binding supplies `run`, `when` and `within`; everything a *reader* needs —
 * the chord, the name, the sentence, which mode it works in — comes from this
 * table. `CommandId` is a union, so a mistyped id is a compile error rather
 * than a shortcut that quietly never fires.
 *
 * ## This module must stay loadable by plain Node
 *
 * `scripts/gen-controls.mjs` imports it directly to generate `CONTROLS.md`, so
 * it may contain **no value imports** — Node's type stripper erases `import
 * type` before module resolution, but a real import would need an extension it
 * does not have. `catalog.test.ts` enforces this. Keep this file data and pure
 * functions; anything that needs the DOM belongs in `registry.ts`.
