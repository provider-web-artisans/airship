   * Publish one side's placement.
   *
   * Four custom properties and two classes, and the dock and its collapsed pill
   * both read them — which is what keeps the invariant the docked arrangement
   * already had: the pill sits exactly where the header was, so collapsing a
   * panel drops the body away rather than moving anything. The vars go on
   * `documentElement` beside the widths, for the same reason they do.
   *
   * `x` and `r` are the same edge expressed from either side, and both are
   * published because a *pill* is narrower than the panel it stands for, so the
   * edge it should keep is not the edge the panel is positioned from. The left
   * pill anchors on `x`; the right pill anchors on `r`, or collapsing a 360px
   * panel into a ~110px pill would hold the left edge and drag the right one
   * inwards — the panel would appear to collapse leftwards, away from the edge
   * it lives on. `trackFloatingResize` compensates for the same asymmetry in the
   * resize gesture, and for the same reason.
   *
   * Height is clamped **here and not in the state**. A panel torn off its edge
   * starts at full height, so carrying it downwards would run its foot off the
   * bottom of the window; but clamping the stored number would make that a
   * one-way trip, shrinking the panel a little on every downward drag and never
   * giving it back when you carry it up again. So `h` keeps what the user asked
   * for and only what is *painted* is fitted to the room below `y`.
   *
   * Docked, `--*-h` comes from `size[side].h` instead, and only `.dock-h` — set
   * when that is non-zero — makes the stylesheet read it. A docked panel with no
   * pinned height keeps its `bottom` anchor and fills its edge, which is a fact
   * about the window that CSS can maintain for free and JS would have to
   * recompute on every resize.

   * The one bar, in five zones:
   *
   *     [ ↺ ↻ ] │ [ Move Text ] │ [ Inspect ] │ [ Edit ⇄ View ] │ {stage tools}
   *
   * Tools and mode are deliberately both present. Edit/View answers "is the page
   * underneath interactive at all"; the tools answer "what does a click do while
   * you are editing". Collapsing them into one control would mean either losing
   * view mode or pretending Inspect and View are the same thing, and they are
   * not — you can inspect while the page is inert.
   *
   * The first three zones are edit-mode furniture and are hidden in view mode
   * (see `syncBar`), which leaves the bar carrying only the two things that are
   * true in both: which mode you are in, and where you are looking. Undo, the
   * tools and Inspect all act on a selection that view mode does not have, so
   * showing them there was offering controls that could not do anything.
   *
   * View mode has its own furniture in that same slot:
   *
   *     [ ✋ ] [ 1440 × 900 ↻ ⟳ ⧉ − ] │ [ Edit ⇄ View ] │ {stage tools}
   *
   * The Hand, and the selected frame's verbs. The Hand sits where the tools sit
   * because it answers the same question they do — what does a press do — and
   * putting it anywhere else would say the two are different kinds of control.
   * The zone is therefore never empty and never doubled: whichever mode you are
   * in, the bar reads *what a press does*, then *which mode*, then *where you
   * are looking*.
   *
   * The frame group shares that zone for the same kind of reason. The Hand
   * answers "what does a press do"; the group answers "what can you do to the
   * thing you picked" — the same question one step on, and it is empty until
   * there is something to ask it about. It is the stage's, filled through
   * `mountFrameTools`; the bar owns only the slot and hides it by mode.
   *
   * The brand and the panel toggles used to live here too; they are in the
   * corner pills now, beside the panels they belong to.
   *
   * The separators are held rather than built anonymously because they have to
   * go with the group they divide — a hairline stub hanging off the mode toggle
   * is worse than either.
