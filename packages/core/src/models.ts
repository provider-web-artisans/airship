/**
 * Which models each backend will accept, asked of the backend itself.
 *
 * The five harnesses answer this question very differently, and the asymmetry
 * is the whole reason this module exists:
 *
 * | Backend  | How it enumerates                                        |
 * |----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
 * | claude   | `query.supportedModels()` — live, and account-aware       |
 * | opencode | `client.config.providers()` — live, only what is authed   |
 * | pi       | `pi --list-models` — live, its own catalogue              |
 * | codex    | nothing. No subcommand, no RPC, no config to read        |
 * | dsh      | only inside a session, and that route writes — see below  |
 *
 * So Claude, OpenCode and pi are asked, and Codex and dsh are served from the
 * seed in `@airship/protocol/models`. The seed also backs the others whenever a
 * probe fails, which is the common case on a machine that has only signed into
 * one of them.
 *
 * Nothing here throws. A picker that cannot list models is a degraded menu; a
 * picker that takes the session down with it is a bug. Every failure comes back
 * as a group with a `note` explaining itself.
