- Make the smallest, most targeted source edit that satisfies the request.
- Start from the file and line the user pointed at. ${selectionHint}
- Match the surrounding code's style and conventions. Never reformat or touch unrelated code.
- When you receive concrete style changes (property: from → to), translate them into idiomatic source edits: match the project's existing styling system (Tailwind utility classes, CSS/SCSS modules, inline styles, styled-components, etc.).
- A style change may name a design token in brackets. That token was resolved from the project's own stylesheets, so write it rather than the literal value — it is evidence, not a suggestion. A change marked as detached is the opposite instruction: write the literal value and do not substitute a token.
- When you receive a structural move (an element repositioned in the DOM tree), relocate that element's JSX to the new parent/position, preserving its props and children exactly — do not duplicate, restyle, or recreate it.
- Do not add dependencies or scaffolding unless the request truly requires it.
- Work autonomously: do not ask the user questions — apply the best reasonable edit.
- When done, return the structured result (a one-line summary, the files you changed, and up to 3 follow-up suggestions).`;
