/**
 * The translation half of the model probes.
 *
 * Mostly the pure functions, for the reason `opencode-events.test.ts` gives about
 * its own: the probes themselves start a subprocess and talk to an account, so
 * a test that covered them would be testing the machine it ran on. What is
 * worth pinning is the mapping — which fields become a row, and which shapes
 * are dropped on the way.
 *
 * The exception is the last block, which stubs `getAdapter` to cover the one
 * behaviour the module's header promises and no mapping test can reach: that a
 * backend which cannot be loaded at all comes back as a note rather than a
 * rejection.
