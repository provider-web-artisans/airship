 *
 * What counts as "matters" differs by caller, which is what `WizardOptions` is
 * for: a bare launch settles only what it needs to start, while `init` is
 * writing a file meant to outlive the session and can afford to ask more.
 *
 * Every prompt is gated on a TTY at both ends by the caller. In a pipe or a CI
 * job there is nobody to answer, and a prompt there does not fail — it hangs,
 * which is the worst failure a CLI has.
