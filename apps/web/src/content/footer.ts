/*
 * The footer's link columns.
 *
 * Short on purpose. The obvious move is four columns of eight — Product,
 * Company, Resources, Legal — but airship is a CLI in one repository, and every
 * one of those columns would have to be filled with pages that do not exist.
 * These are the links that resolve today.
 *
 * Two entries in site.json's `links` are deliberately NOT referenced here.
 * Both now name the right thing and still do not resolve: `license` points at
 * /blob/main/LICENSE, which the repo has, but the repo is not public yet; `npm`
 * points at @provider-web-artisans/cli, which is the package apps/cli publishes but has
 * not published. A footer is the worst place to keep a dead link — it is the
 * part of a page people trust to be boringly correct. Add them back to
 * footer.json once the repo is public and the first version is on npm.
